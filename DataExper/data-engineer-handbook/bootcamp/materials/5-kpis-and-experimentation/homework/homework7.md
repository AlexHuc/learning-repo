# eMag: User Journey and Experimentation Strategy

## User Journey

I have been using eMag for several years, and my experience has evolved as the platform has grown and improved. Here’s a detailed walkthrough of my journey with eMag:

### 1. Discovery & Onboarding

**First Visit:**

- I first discovered eMag through online ads and word-of-mouth.
- The website’s clear layout, extensive catalog, and ease-of-use immediately caught my attention.

**Registration:**

- Signing up was simple and fast, with a minimal registration form and options for social media integration that streamlined the process.

**Initial Impressions:**

- I appreciated receiving a personalized welcome email that not only highlighted popular products but also offered first-time purchase discounts, setting a positive tone for my relationship with the platform.

### 2. Browsing and Shopping

**Product Discovery:**

- The robust search functionality, clearly organized product categories, and detailed filtering options make browsing efficient.
- Personalized recommendations based on my browsing history help me discover products aligned with my interests.

**Product Page Experience:**

- Detailed product descriptions, comprehensive user reviews, high-quality images, and related product suggestions contribute to a rich shopping experience and informed decision making.

**Cart and Checkout:**

- The checkout process is seamless, featuring multiple payment options (credit/debit cards, cash on delivery, etc.) and a transparent shipping policy that builds trust and confidence in completing the purchase.

### 3. Post-Purchase Engagement

**Order Tracking:**

- eMag’s order tracking system provides regular updates on shipping and delivery, which keeps me informed and reassured about my purchase’s progress.

**Customer Support:**

- Accessible customer service via live chat and phone support ensures that any issues or questions are resolved quickly and effectively.

**Re-engagement & Loyalty:**

- Regular newsletters, personalized product recommendations based on past purchases, and exclusive deals on subsequent visits have continued to enhance my loyalty over time.

## Experimentation Strategy

To further enhance user engagement and improve the overall shopping experience on eMag, I propose the following three experiments:

### Experiment 1: Personalized Product Bundles for Increased Average Order Value

**Objective:**

Test whether showing personalized product bundle suggestions (e.g., complementary items often bought together) on the product page increases the average order value (AOV).

**Design Details:**

- **Test Groups:**
  - **Control Group (50%):**  
    Users see the standard product page without personalized bundle suggestions.
  - **Test Group (50%):**  
    Users are presented with personalized product bundle recommendations based on their browsing history and complementary product relationships.

**Hypotheses:**

- **Null Hypothesis:**  
  Displaying personalized product bundles does not significantly change the AOV compared to the standard product page.
- **Alternative Hypothesis:**  
  Displaying personalized product bundles increases the AOV compared to the standard product page.

**Metrics:**

- **Leading Metric:**  
  Click-through rate (CTR) on the bundle suggestions.
- **Lagging Metric:**  
  Increase in the average order value (AOV) per transaction.

### Experiment 2: Enhanced Search Autocomplete with Visuals to Improve Product Discovery

**Objective:**

Determine whether an enhanced search experience—with autocomplete suggestions featuring product images and brief key details—helps users find products more easily and reduces search time.

**Design Details:**

- **Test Groups:**
  - **Control Group (50%):**  
    Users interact with the existing search bar that uses text-only autocomplete suggestions.
  - **Test Group (50%):**  
    Users interact with a redesigned search bar where the autocomplete suggestions include product images and key product details.

**Hypotheses:**

- **Null Hypothesis:**  
  There is no significant difference in the time-to-find or engagement rate with search results between the visual-enhanced autocomplete and the text-only version.
- **Alternative Hypothesis:**  
  The visual-enhanced autocomplete reduces the time-to-find products and increases user engagement with the search results.

**Metrics:**

- **Leading Metric:**  
  Decrease in the average time taken to click on a search result.
- **Lagging Metric:**  
  Increase in successful product searches (conversion rate from search to product detail page views) and overall site engagement.

### Experiment 3: Dynamic Pricing Offers Based on Cart Abandonment to Boost Conversion Rates

**Objective:**

Test if offering dynamic, personalized discounts on items left in the shopping cart reduces cart abandonment and increases the conversion rate.

**Design Details:**

- **Test Groups:**
  - **Control Group (50%):**  
    Users who leave items in the cart receive the standard reminder email.
  - **Test Group (50%):**  
    Users who leave items in the cart are sent a dynamic pricing offer email, featuring a small, personalized discount based on the cart’s value and product category.

**Hypotheses:**

- **Null Hypothesis:**  
  Dynamic pricing offers do not significantly reduce the cart abandonment rate compared to standard reminder emails.
- **Alternative Hypothesis:**  
  Dynamic pricing offers reduce cart abandonment and lead to a higher conversion rate compared to standard reminder emails.

**Metrics:**

- **Leading Metric:**  
  Percentage of users clicking on the dynamic pricing offer email.
- **Lagging Metric:**  
  Increase in conversion rate (final checkout completions) and a reduction in the overall cart abandonment rate.

## Conclusion

By understanding the complete user journey on eMag—from discovery and onboarding, through the shopping experience, to post-purchase engagement—and testing targeted improvements through these experiments, eMag can further enhance the user experience, increase transaction values, and improve customer retention. Each experiment has:

- A clear objective
- Defined test groups with a 50%-50% cell allocation
- Leading and lagging metrics to assess both short-term engagement and long-term business impact

This structured approach will help eMag gain deeper insights into user behavior while continuously optimizing its platform to meet the evolving needs of its customers.
