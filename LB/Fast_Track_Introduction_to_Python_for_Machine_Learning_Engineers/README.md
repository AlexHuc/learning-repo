# Fast Track Introduction to Python for Machine Learning Engineers

This is a Template Project that reflects the Python and Machine Learning basic knowledge for a Machine Learning Engineer.

## Machine Learning Basics

### The Artificial Intelligence Hierarchy

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Intelligence exhibited by machine or software
  - **Machine Learning**: The functionality that helps software perform task without explicit programming or rules
    - **Deep Learning**: A form of machine learning model that is loosely inspired by the strucutre of the human brain
    - **Traditional Models**: Machine Learning models that aren't deep learning models
